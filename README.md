# microbiome_triaGe
R script for microbiome data visualization 
The goal of this project is to develop a convenient R Script for an initial visual exploration of animal microbiome data from longitudinal studies.  It will provide researchers with crucial microbiome plots to develop intuition of the data patterns present in their datasets and guide their further statistical analysis.

## Package and data types 
The script requires the installation of the following packages:
- Phyloseq
- Tidyverse
- gridExtra
- metagenomeSeq
- vegan
- table1
- microbiome

*The script accepts rds as input file and csv as parameters file.*
